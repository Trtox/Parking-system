# Parking system
This system was developed as part of a group project for the college course Basics of Software Engineering. The application was built using the C# .NET framework with a Windows Forms environment, ensuring a user-friendly and responsive interface.

License plate recognition functionality is implemented through a lightweight Python application integrated with Tesseract OCR, enabling efficient and accurate text extraction. The system leverages a locally hosted SQLite database for secure and reliable data storage, ensuring seamless performance.
